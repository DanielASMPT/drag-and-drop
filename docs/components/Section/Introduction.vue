      Drag and Drop is a small library for adding drag and drop functionality to
      your app. It’s simple, flexible, framework agnostic, and clocks in at only
      ~5kb gzipped. Drag and Drop works with React, Solid, Vue, Svelte, or any
      JavaScript framework. This library differs from others in the way the drag
      and drop operations are performed. Rather than moving elements around the
      DOM manually, Drag and Drop updates the reactive data model used by the
      provided render function.
